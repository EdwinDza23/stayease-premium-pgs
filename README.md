## 🧠 AI Assistance & Credits

This project was built with the help of **Google AI Studio (Gemini)** during the initial development phase.

AI was used for:
- Component scaffolding
- Rapid iteration of UI ideas
- Boilerplate generation

All final UI/UX decisions, layout refinement, and project structure were **manually reviewed, modified, and implemented** to ensure usability and production readiness.
